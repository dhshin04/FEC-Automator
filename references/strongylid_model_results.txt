200 images used for training, validation, and test sets
    - 80 images were generated using data augmentation techniques, implemented
      using Roboflow (specifics under .../strongylid_dataset/README.roboflow.txt)

Data Augmentation used during training: random rotate by 90, random horizontal flip
