Structure of Torchvision's Faster R-CNN MobileNet-Large-FPN Model:

Feature extraction - MobileNet (for faster computation)
    - model.backbone.body
        .parameters() for just param OR named_parameters() to access layer names
Consistency in feature maps - FPN (for objects of varying sizes)
    - model.backbone.fpn
Region proposals of where objects likely are based on features - RPN
    - model.rpn
Classification & bounding box predictions - ROI Heads
    - model.roi_heads
